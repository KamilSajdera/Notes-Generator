- set title,
- select type of sound (note/rest), value of note and pitch,

- done sheet music might be print, just click 'print',
- select key (Cmajor, Dmajor etc...),
- you can listen what you written at the right pace! Just give value (in beats per second) and click 'Play'. Notes will be played.
- this app makes sure that the note values ​​in the sheet music are correct. Automatically disables those values ​​that can no longer be used in the measure and switches to the next possible option.
